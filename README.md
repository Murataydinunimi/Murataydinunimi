<h1 align="center"> About Me üåç </h1>




I'm a  Data Engineer with a passion for creating efficient, sustainable, and impactful data solutions. 
Throughout my career, I‚Äôve built a variety of data engineering projects where I developed expertise in data modelling, ETL processes, Dev-ops and cloud services, always beginning with a positive "can-do" mindset and a commitment to best practices. 
I believe that a strong foundation in both practical skills and theoretical knowledge is key to effective data engineering.
My continuous learning journey keeps me up-to-date on topics like distributed computing, big data applications, real-time data streaming, and cloud architecture.
